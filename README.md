    drop all null objects
    use One hot encode for date column by season
    use label encode for binary type columns
    use StandardScaler
    Kfold cross validation XGBRegressor shows equal loss
    permutation_importance on XGBRegressor shows huge gap between one feature against rest
    RandomForestRegressor permutation_importance same huge gap between one feature against rest
